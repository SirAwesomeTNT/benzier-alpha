Yes, your idea of calculating the average squared distance from each original point to the corresponding point on the Bezier curve sounds feasible and is a common approach to quantify the goodness of fit in curve approximation. This measure is often referred to as the "mean squared error" (MSE) or "residual sum of squares."

The MSE is a numerical value that represents the average squared difference between the actual y-values of the original points and the y-values predicted by the Bezier curve. A lower MSE indicates a better fit.

Here are some suggestions and next steps:

1. **Evaluate Different Bezier Curve Degrees:**
   Try experimenting with different degrees of Bezier curves. You're currently using cubic Bezier curves, but you might want to explore higher or lower degrees to see how they affect the precision. Keep track of the MSE for each degree.

2. **Adjust Control Points:**
   Modify the control points of the Bezier curve to minimize the MSE. You can explore optimization algorithms to automatically adjust the control points to improve the fit.

3. **Consider Different Interpolation Methods:**
   Evaluate different interpolation methods to generate the control points. The way you interpolate points between the original ones can impact the resulting Bezier curve.

4. **Visualize Residuals:**
   Plot the residuals (the differences between actual and predicted y-values) to identify regions where the fit is not accurate. This can guide adjustments to the curve.

5. **Explore Local Adjustments:**
   Instead of adjusting the entire curve, consider local adjustments in regions where the fit is less precise. This could involve using different degrees of curves for different segments.

6. **Regularization Techniques:**
   Investigate regularization techniques to prevent overfitting. Regularization methods can help balance precision and generalization.

7. **Compare Against Other Curve Fitting Methods:**
   Compare the Bezier curve fitting results with other curve fitting methods, such as polynomial fitting or spline interpolation. This can provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.

8. **User Feedback:**
   If applicable, gather feedback from users who interact with the curves. Their feedback can provide valuable insights into what aspects of the curves are important for your application.

Remember that the choice of the best-fitting curve depends on the specific requirements and characteristics of your data. Experimentation and iteration are key to refining and improving your curve fitting approach.
